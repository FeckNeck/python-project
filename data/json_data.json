CICERO is the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in the game Diplomacy. Diplomacy is a complex strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation between seven players. \\u00a0 Over the course of 40 two-hour games with 82 human players, CICERO achieved more than double the average score of other players, ranked in the top 10% of players who played more than one game, and placed 2nd out of 19 participants who played at least 5 games. \\u00a0 Here are some highlights from our recent announcement:\\n\\n* **NLP x RL/Planning:**\\u00a0CICERO combines techniques in NLP and RL/planning, by coupling a controllable dialogue module with a strategic reasoning engine.\\u00a0\\n* **Controlling dialogue via plans:**\\u00a0In addition to being grounded in the game state and dialogue history, CICERO\\u2019s dialogue model was trained to be controllable via a set of intents or plans in the game. This allows CICERO to use language intentionally and to move beyond imitation learning by conditioning on plans selected by the strategic reasoning engine.\\n* **Selecting plans:**\\u00a0CICERO uses a strategic reasoning module to make plans (and select intents) in the game. This module runs a planning algorithm which takes into account the game state, the dialogue, and the strength/likelihood of various actions. Plans are recomputed every time CICERO sends/receives a message.\\n* **Filtering messages:**\\u00a0We built an ensemble of classifiers to detect low quality messages, like messages contradicting the game state/dialogue history or messages which have low strategic value. We used this ensemble to aggressively filter CICERO\\u2019s messages.\\u00a0\\n* **Human-like play:**\\u00a0Over the course of 72 hours of play \\u2013 which involved sending 5,277 messages \\u2013 CICERO was not detected as an AI agent.\\n\\nYou can check out some of our materials and open-sourced artifacts here:\\u00a0\\n\\n* [Research paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097)\\n* [Project overview](https://ai.facebook.com/research/cicero/)\\n* [Diplomacy gameplay page](https://ai.facebook.com/research/cicero/diplomacy/)\\n* [Github repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/diplomacy_cicero)\\n* [Our latest blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/cicero-ai-negotiates-persuades-and-cooperates-with-people/)\\n\\nJoining us today for the AMA are:\\n\\n* Andrew Goff (AG), 3x Diplomacy World Champion\\n* Alexander Miller (AM), Research Engineering Manager\\n* Noam Brown (NB), Research Scientist [(u/NoamBrown)](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoamBrown/)\\n* Mike Lewis (ML), Research Scientist [(u/mikelewis0)](https://www.reddit.com/user/mikelewis0/)\\n* David Wu (DW), Research Engineer [(u/icosaplex)](https://www.reddit.com/user/icosaplex/)\\n* Emily Dinan (ED), Research Engineer\\n* Anton Bakhtin (AB), Research Engineer\\n* Adam Lerer (AL), Research Engineer\\n* Jonathan Gray (JG), Research Engineer\\n* Colin Flaherty (CF), Research Engineer [(u/c-flaherty)](https://www.reddit.com/user/c-flaherty)\\n\\nWe\\u2019ll be here on December 8, 2022 @ 10:00AM PT - 11:00AM PT.\",\n                    \"score\": 585,\n                    \"nbComments\": 158\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"jsonathan\": {\n            \"py/object\": \"modules.Author.Author\",\n            \"name\": \"jsonathan\",\n            \"production\": [\n                {\n                    \"py/object\": \"modules.Document.RedditDocument\",\n                    \"titre\": \"[P] I made a command-line tool that explains your errors using ChatGPT (link in comments)\",\n                    \"auteur\": \"jsonathan\",\n                    \"date\": \"2022-12-10 13:32:57\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://i.redd.it/kq518l9ne25a1.gif\",\n                    \"text\": \"\",\n                    \"score\": 2150,\n                    \"nbComments\": 96\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"RandomForests92\": {\n            \"py/object\": \"modules.Author.Author\",\n            \"name\": \"RandomForests92\",\n            \"production\": [\n                {\n                    \"py/object\": \"modules.Document.RedditDocument\",\n                    \"titre\": \"[Project] Football Players Tracking with YOLOv5 + ByteTRACK\",\n                    \"auteur\": \"RandomForests92\",\n                    \"date\": \"2022-12-10 15:00:57\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://v.redd.it/ps4cdy3it25a1\",\n                    \"text\": \"\",\n                    \"score\": 425,\n                    \"nbComments\": 62\n                }\n            ]\n        },\n        \"Shardsmp\": {\n            \"py/object\": \"modules.Author.Author\",\n            \"name\": \"Shardsmp\",\n            \"production\": [\n                {\n                    \"py/object\": \"modules.Document.RedditDocument\",\n                    \"titre\": \"[D] Does Google TPU v4 compete with GPUs in price/performance?\",\n                    \"auteur\": \"Shardsmp\",\n                    \"date\": \"2022-12-11 09:43:03\",\n                    \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/zil35t/d_does_google_tpu_v4_compete_with_gpus_in/\",\n                    \"text\": \"Fellow machine learning enthusiast here!\\n\\nI want to train a large NLP model and I'm wondering whether its worth it to use Google Cloud's TPU's for it.

CICERO is the first AI agent to achieve human-level performance in the game Diplomacy. Diplomacy is a complex strategy game involving both cooperation and competition that emphasizes natural language negotiation between seven players. \\u00a0 Over the course of 40 two-hour games with 82 human players, CICERO achieved more than double the average score of other players, ranked in the top 10% of players who played more than one game, and placed 2nd out of 19 participants who played at least 5 games. \\u00a0 Here are some highlights from our recent announcement:\\n\\n* **NLP x RL/Planning:**\\u00a0CICERO combines techniques in NLP and RL/planning, by coupling a controllable dialogue module with a strategic reasoning engine.\\u00a0\\n* **Controlling dialogue via plans:**\\u00a0In addition to being grounded in the game state and dialogue history, CICERO\\u2019s dialogue model was trained to be controllable via a set of intents or plans in the game. This allows CICERO to use language intentionally and to move beyond imitation learning by conditioning on plans selected by the strategic reasoning engine.\\n* **Selecting plans:**\\u00a0CICERO uses a strategic reasoning module to make plans (and select intents) in the game. This module runs a planning algorithm which takes into account the game state, the dialogue, and the strength/likelihood of various actions. Plans are recomputed every time CICERO sends/receives a message.\\n* **Filtering messages:**\\u00a0We built an ensemble of classifiers to detect low quality messages, like messages contradicting the game state/dialogue history or messages which have low strategic value. We used this ensemble to aggressively filter CICERO\\u2019s messages.\\u00a0\\n* **Human-like play:**\\u00a0Over the course of 72 hours of play \\u2013 which involved sending 5,277 messages \\u2013 CICERO was not detected as an AI agent.\\n\\nYou can check out some of our materials and open-sourced artifacts here:\\u00a0\\n\\n* [Research paper](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade9097)\\n* [Project overview](https://ai.facebook.com/research/cicero/)\\n* [Diplomacy gameplay page](https://ai.facebook.com/research/cicero/diplomacy/)\\n* [Github repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/diplomacy_cicero)\\n* [Our latest blog post](https://ai.facebook.com/blog/cicero-ai-negotiates-persuades-and-cooperates-with-people/)\\n\\nJoining us today for the AMA are:\\n\\n* Andrew Goff (AG), 3x Diplomacy World Champion\\n* Alexander Miller (AM), Research Engineering Manager\\n* Noam Brown (NB), Research Scientist [(u/NoamBrown)](https://www.reddit.com/user/NoamBrown/)\\n* Mike Lewis (ML), Research Scientist [(u/mikelewis0)](https://www.reddit.com/user/mikelewis0/)\\n* David Wu (DW), Research Engineer [(u/icosaplex)](https://www.reddit.com/user/icosaplex/)\\n* Emily Dinan (ED), Research Engineer\\n* Anton Bakhtin (AB), Research Engineer\\n* Adam Lerer (AL), Research Engineer\\n* Jonathan Gray (JG), Research Engineer\\n* Colin Flaherty (CF), Research Engineer [(u/c-flaherty)](https://www.reddit.com/user/c-flaherty)\\n\\nWe\\u2019ll be here on December 8, 2022 @ 10:00AM PT - 11:00AM PT.\",\n            \"score\": 585,\n            \"nbComments\": 158\n        },\n        \"2\": {\n            \"py/object\": \"modules.Document.RedditDocument\",\n            \"titre\": \"[P] I made a command-line tool that explains your errors using ChatGPT (link in comments)\",\n            \"auteur\": \"jsonathan\",\n            \"date\": \"2022-12-10 13:32:57\",\n            \"url\": \"https://i.redd.it/kq518l9ne25a1.gif\",\n            \"text\": \"\",\n            \"score\": 2150,\n            \"nbComments\": 96\n        },\n        \"3\": {\n            \"py/object\": \"modules.Document.RedditDocument\",\n            \"titre\": \"[Project] Football Players Tracking with YOLOv5 + ByteTRACK\",\n            \"auteur\": \"RandomForests92\",\n            \"date\": \"2022-12-10 15:00:57\",\n            \"url\": \"https://v.redd.it/ps4cdy3it25a1\",\n            \"text\": \"\",\n            \"score\": 425,\n            \"nbComments\": 62\n        },\n        \"4\": {\n            \"py/object\": \"modules.Document.RedditDocument\",\n            \"titre\": \"[D] Does Google TPU v4 compete with GPUs in price/performance?\",\n            \"auteur\": \"Shardsmp\",\n            \"date\": \"2022-12-11 09:43:03\",\n            \"url\": \"https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/zil35t/d_does_google_tpu_v4_compete_with_gpus_in/\",\n            \"text\": \"Fellow machine learning enthusiast here!\\n\\nI want to train a large NLP model and I'm wondering whether its worth it to use Google Cloud's TPU's for it.
